For ALIGNN, the dataset of 133,725 POSCAR structures was split once into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets. This split was kept fixed for all experiments. Each ALIGNN model was trained five times with different random seeds to account for randomness in parameter initialization and optimization. All reported performance metrics correspond to the mean over these five independent runs.
